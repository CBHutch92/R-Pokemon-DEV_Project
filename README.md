# About the R Pokemon Project

# This project was fully developed by me. The overall goal was to dive deeper into this Pokemon dataset. I completed this project alone and wrote the code myself. This was our final project for my Data Exploration and Visualization course (MATH 3440).
# I received an A for this project

# The point of this project is to dive deeper into the data and see what new information I could learn, but also see if the beliefs Iâ€™ve created as a Pokemon trainer over years of playing various games are backed up by the data using the techniques learned from our previous projects.
